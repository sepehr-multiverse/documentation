1d:T1433,The result of the submitted job had 1 PUB and has a value:
 PrimitiveResult([PubResult(data=DataBin(evs=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), stds=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), ensemble_standard_error=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), shape=(3, 100)), metadata={'shots': 4096, 'target_precision': 0.015625, 'circuit_metadata': {}, 'resilience': {}, 'num_randomizations': 32})], metadata={'dynamical_decoupling': {'enable': False, 'sequence_type': 'XX', 'extra_slack_distribution': 'middle', 'scheduling_method': 'alap'}, 'twirling': {'enable_gates': False, 'enable_measure': True, 'num_randomizations': 'auto', 'shots_per_randomization': 'auto', 'interleave_randomizations': True, 'strategy': 'active-accum'}, 'resilience': {'measure_mitigation': True, 'zne_mitigation': False, 'pec_mitigation': False}, 'version': 2})

The associated PubResult of this job has the following data bins:
 DataBin(evs=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), stds=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), ensemble_standard_error=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), shape=(3, 100))

And this DataBin has attributes: dict_keys(['evs', 'stds', 'ensemble_standard_error'])
Recall that this shape is due to our array of parameter binding sets having shape (100, 2) -- where 2 is the
         number of parameters in the circuit -- combined with our array of observables having shape (3, 1).
