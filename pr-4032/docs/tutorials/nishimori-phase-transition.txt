Nishimori phase transition on a quantum processor using the GEM protocol. The metrics that you examined during post-processing, in particular the two-point correlation and the normalized variance, serve as benchmarks of the device's ability to generate long-range entangled states. These benchmarks extend the utility of the GEM protocol beyond probing interesting physics. As part of the protocol, you entangled qubits across the entire device using circuits of only constant depth. This feat is only possible due to the protocol's use of mid-circuit measurements. In this experiment, the entangled state was immediately measured, but an interesting avenue to explore would be to continue using the state in additional quantum processing!","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n",[["$","hr",null,{"className":"mt-48 lg:mt-64 mb-16 md:mb-24 my-16 lg:my-24 border-t border-border-subtle box-content overflow-visible"}],["$","h2",null,{"id":"tutorial-survey","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] [overflow-wrap:anywhere] text-heading-04 text-text-primary","children":["Tutorial survey",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","href":"#tutorial-survey","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline heading-permalink ml-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 focus:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":["$14","$16","$undefined"]}]}]]}]],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Please take this short survey to provide feedback on this tutorial.
