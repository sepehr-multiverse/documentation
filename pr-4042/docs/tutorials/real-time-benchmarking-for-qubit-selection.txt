over time (we'll consider a single week below), we see how these can fluctuate on a scale of a single day.

Moreover, if a job is transpiled locally (using current reported properties) and submitted but executed only at a later time (minutes or days), it may run the risk of having used outdated properties for qubit selection in the transpilation step.
