After the oracle has marked the target state, we apply a series of operations that increase the amplitude of this marked state, making it more likely to be observed upon measurement. This process is achieved through the ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"Diffusion operator"}],", which effectively performs an inversion about the average amplitude.
