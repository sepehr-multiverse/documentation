But keep in mind: this is the quantum computing analog of the experiments done with particles with magnetic moments. If we had expected an even spread between 0 and +1, it might indeed have surprised us that we obtained one extremum on our first measurement. It is this surprising quantization of results in the Stern-Gerlach experiment that led us to a better understanding of nature, and that in turn helped us eventually build quantum computers.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Let's see what happens when we make an ensemble of measurements.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n",[["$","hr",null,{"className":"mt-48 lg:mt-64 mb-16 md:mb-24 my-16 lg:my-24 border-t border-border-subtle box-content overflow-visible"}],["$","h2",null,{"id":"second-experiment-measuring-many-particles","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] [overflow-wrap:anywhere] text-heading-04 text-text-primary","children":["Second experiment: Measuring many particles",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","href":"#second-experiment-measuring-many-particles","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline heading-permalink ml-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 focus:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":["$17","$19","$undefined"]}]}]]}]],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"To gather statistics on many such measurements, we don't need to repeat steps 1 & 2.
