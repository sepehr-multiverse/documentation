For example, if the function were constant, and you kept measuring \"1\" as the output of the function, then you couldn't be certain that it was truly constant until you checked over half of the results. Before then, you might have just been very unlucky to keep measuring \"1\" on a balanced function. It's like flipping a coin over and over and it landing heads every time.
