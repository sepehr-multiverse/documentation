In simulation-type experiments, VQE is one of the most common approaches, and the first step is almost always the same: prepare the ground state. In this case, it is a vacuum state. In this experiment, they use a new version of VQE called SC-ADAPT-VQE (which stands for Scalable Circuits - Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter ansatz-VQE) to prepare both the ground state and the hadron wave packet on this vacuum.
