Indeed, there are cases where structures borrowed from classical neural networks, such as convolution layers, play an important role in VQCs. In such cases where the analogy is strong, QNNs may be a useful description. But parameterized quantum circuits need not follow the general structure of a neural network; for example, not all data need to be loaded in the first (input) layer; we can load some data in the first layer, apply some gates and then load additional data (a process called data \"reuploading\").

Our previous variational circuit contained CNOT gates between qubits (and therefore pixels) 0 and 1, 1 and 2, and 2 and 3. That covers any horizontal lines across the top of the image, but it does not directly detect vertical lines, nor does it completely detect horizontal lines, as it ignores the lower row. To fully detect all horizontal lines, we would want to have a similar set of CNOT gates between qubits (pixels) 4 and 5, 5 and 6, and 6 and 7. We could keep in mind that adding CNOT gates between qubits corresponding to vertical lines (like 0 and 4, or 2 and 6) may also be useful.
