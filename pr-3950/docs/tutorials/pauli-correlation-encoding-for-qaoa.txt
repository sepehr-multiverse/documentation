PCE maps classical variables in optimization problems to multi-body Pauli-matrix correlations, resulting in a polynomial compression of the problem's space requirements. By employing PCE, the number of qubits needed for encoding is reduced, making it particularly advantageous for near-term quantum devices with limited qubit resources. Furthermore, it is analytically demonstrated that PCE inherently mitigates barren plateaus, offering super-polynomial resilience against this phenomenon.
