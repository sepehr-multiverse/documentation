Their classical simulability also makes them useful for verifying the output of quantum computers. For example, suppose you want to execute a quantum circuit that uses 100 qubits on a quantum computer. How do you know that the quantum computer is behaving correctly? A quantum circuit on 100 qubits is beyond the reach of brute-force classical simulation. By modifying your circuit so that it becomes a stabilizer circuit, you can run circuits on the quantum computer that have a similar structure to your desired circuit, but which you can simulate on a classical computer. By checking the output of the quantum computer on the stabilizer circuits, you can gain confidence that it is behaving correctly on the non-stabilizer circuits as well.
